So if you already know what X, K and KA bands are then good for you, but if you are like me and you just wanted a radar detector that is easy to use and understand then this is not the one for you.<br><br>I tried to use it for about a week but it drove me crazy so I threw it in the trash just now.<br><br>The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because technically it does detect radar so it isn't broken, it is just useless in suburban areas. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZRG8IWLQRDF6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086B88TGR","rating":2,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020","utc":"2020-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Justin Baker","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFSSHONWTCGQNQETTZOMKMNIT7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AHFSSHONWTCGQNQETTZOMKMNIT7A"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":7,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R1KPPWIG1HTRBK","title":"Distance and easy to use.","body":"This radar detector has helped me avoid several traffic tickets already.

This is not like a point and shoot camera that works wonders out of the box. Out of the box, it will be chatty due to the fact that it has a front and rear horns. Before installing the R7 in your vehicle, you MUST update the firmware. VortexRadar on youtube will guide you on a step by step procedure using MAC or PC. The next step is to adjust sensitivity of K band to your liking. Why? This will reduce false alerts from automatic door openers. BSM (blind spot monitor) alerts from cars specially Pacificas, Mazda's, Honda's/Acura's, Jeep and etc. Start from 50% down to 30%. Even at 30%, it still is matching some of the top radar detector like Escorts as far as detection range is concern. You can also use the Quiet Ride feature that mutes K band signals below a threshold speed you choose from 10 mph to 90 mph. I use 55 mph setting for my quiet ride settings. If you use the default K band tone alert, you will get 2 muted beeps when a K band source is detected and has a threshold time before it alerts again with 2 muted beeps. Meaning, that if a signal dies down and a new one is detected within the threshold time, you will not hear those 2 muted beeps. Understand that having two horns in one package will be chattier. One reviewer has made a comment that the R3 is quieter in a way but not much The R7 is basically 2 R3's in one. Meaning that if you have 2 R3's facing the opposite direction, your alerts will be the same as an R7 except the R7 has arrows. Bottom line, you \" have to set the K band setting's right to your liking \" to have a pleasant driving experience. The R7 was built with many features to address your needs to accommodate a wide range of radar detector users. Play with your K band sensitivity settings and quiet ride features. You will be amazed on how this unit works. To add better visual alerts, set your display mode to Dark Mode. This keeps the screen blank and displays all the information you need once a source is detected. It also helps prevent display burnout. The R7 has also a feature that will announce the direction where the source is coming from , the band(X,K and KA) and frequency(only when Ka band is detected). Also turn TSF on. Helps decrease some false alerts. Also make sure K block is turned on. This blocks BSM alerts from older models Honda's/Acura's 2018 and below. Newer Honda's/Acura's will still alert the R7 since they are not under the K band frequency block. The R7 is one of the best radar detectors out there and has very good range in K and Ka band. You cannot have increase range with too much filtering to minimize false alerts. You just need to find the sweet spot that works well for you. If you are a newbie and wanted to learn, this may work well for you. 1/1/20 update: Raised my quiet ride settings to 90 mph. It's one of the quietest radar detector out there.

Mounted in 2017 Golf R, received the R7 April 18 and have used since then and replaced a Escort Max 360 which I loved. I-5 in Fife Washington is getting hammered by WSP too slow everyone down to 50 and so far have had 5-6 bogeys every morning at 4am for 2 weeks. Scott I have been hit every morning by KA band by 3-6 hits by half a mile easy and no laser is being used by WSP in cars but motorcycle cops use laser almost all the time so watch for them, usually on the way home. Through the Fife area 1 mile before or after set cruise control to 50 and do not speed through this area, EVER!! In two weeks I have been paced from behind going North in this area twice and one cop had his radar on and got him really early with the rear radar as he nailed the truck behind me doing 70 coming up on me doing 65----close but I new he was back there so I was slowing from 75 from just a minute before. One day hit by Laser with R7 but luckily had adaptive cruise set at 65 and had no hit on detector but saw cop point gun at me and switch to others behind me so be careful with laser detection. KA about the same so far as Max 360 but K band is far superior with R7 and people will tell you no K band really in WA but so far 3 hits from WSP and one in Kent Wa with all cops with radar on full time and picked them up so far I thought all were Hondas or GMC, nope. Falsing so far is about same as Max 360 new software update helped a little on Hondas but trip to Oregon this weekend still picking them up but they need to be really close. Trip to Oregon on Thursday mostly quiet especially in Oregon, creepy did 200 miles no cops and even drove all the way around Mount Hood but nothing! No cops, nothing? Hit 120 once or twice maybe not saying I did but had fun and hope no hidden cameras like they use in Oregon but the locals speed quite a bit. Now on the way back to WA going N at about 7am just past Vancouver WA got a K band from the rear in and out with nobody behind for about 1 mile just a small pack that was following a pack I was in doing 75. First thought was a false from a car or something but detector didn't quit alerting and it was getting stronger so my spidey sense didn't feel right so I set cruise again to 70. Finally saw a car come through the pack from behind with led lights wasn't sure what it was and I was losing the pack I was in because I cut 5 mph just to be safe. Guess what a WSP dark grey Dodge went full K band at a mile back once his pack cleared and he went into the slow lane and hit the beans and caught me in a couple of seconds with detector screaming K band all the way and it was only set at 60% K band!! Wife was impressed the detector had him about 5 minutes before and we agreed the detector just paid for itself because earlier we were going quite a bit faster!!! Had one more rear encounter going N at Chehalis WA and picked it up again early with full on K band going into a 70mph zone to 60mph zone so after last encounter set cruise to 60. Guess what another silver dodge WSP doing about 80 from behind hunting for in front speeders, f --- jerks!! Once again wife was watching detector like a Hawk and was amazed how early the R7 was alerting us on K band. Sorry for long review but Scott You Are Wrong!! In two weeks the R7 probably saved me from a couple of tickets at just a bit over. Max 360 is really good and I like some of its features but its K band range doesn't come close to the R7, I think its over filtered, K band is still out there guys! Arrows are a must as I have had several detectors without them but I will never go back to no Arrows. The R7 switches from front to side to rear faster than the Max 360 but not a deal breaker but so far very impressed with R7!!! Need more time with the R7 but Max 360 currently has saved me over the last year at least 10 times but one ticket on Lidar that was my fault because I didn't react fast enough as it actually gave me a enough time but I was too busy ignoring it. Thanks to Vortex but be careful of band segmentation as I had several readings outside of segmentation on both bands and I don't want to go to court to argue these readings. I run wide on all K and KA bands just to be safe and the R7 still has great range. Lots of K and KA over the last Year so don't believe Scott the lazy cops use RADAR not Lidar!!! Oh and the County Cops coming at you in the oncoming lanes almost always have their RADAR on! Good luck and if you don't have a RADAR detector don't go over 5mph over speed limit or you will get a Ticket!!Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> First off delete Scotts scam review as he doesn't know what he's talking about!!<br>Mounted in 2017 Golf R, received the R7 April 18 and have used since then and replaced a Escort Max 360 which I loved.<br>I-5 in Fife Washington is getting hammered by WSP too slow everyone down to 50 and so far have had 5-6 bogeys every morning at 4am for 2 weeks.

One day hit by Laser with R7 but luckily had adaptive cruise set at 65 and had no hit on detector but saw cop point gun at me and switch to others behind me so be careful with laser detection.<br>KA about the same so far as Max 360 but K band is far superior with R7 and people will tell you no K band really in WA but so far 3 hits from WSP and one in Kent Wa with all cops with radar on full time and picked them up so far I thought all were Hondas or GMC, nope. Falsing so far is about same as Max 360 new software update helped a little on Hondas but trip to Oregon this weekend still picking them up but they need to be really close.<br>Trip to Oregon on Thursday mostly quiet especially in Oregon, creepy did 200 miles no cops and even drove all the way around Mount Hood but nothing! No cops, nothing? Hit 120 once or twice maybe not saying I did but had fun and hope no hidden cameras like they use in Oregon but the locals speed quite a bit.<br>Now on the way back to WA going N at about 7am just past Vancouver WA got a K band from the rear in and out with nobody behind for about 1 mile just a small pack that was following a pack I was in doing 75. First thought was a false from a car or something but detector didn't quit alerting and it was getting stronger so my spidey sense didn't feel right so I set cruise again to 70. Finally saw a car come through the pack from behind with led lights wasn't sure what it was and I was losing the pack I was in because I cut 5 mph just to be safe. Guess what a WSP dark grey Dodge went full K band at a mile back once his pack cleared and he went into the slow lane and hit the beans and caught me in a couple of seconds with detector screaming K band all the way and it was only set at 60% K band!! Wife was impressed the detector had him about 5 minutes before and we agreed the detector just paid for itself because earlier we were going quite a bit faster!!!<br>Had one more rear encounter going N at Chehalis WA and picked it up again early with full on K band going into a 70mph zone to 60mph zone so after last encounter set cruise to 60. Guess what another silver dodge WSP doing about 80 from behind hunting for in front speeders, f --- jerks!! Once again wife was watching detector like a Hawk and was amazed how early the R7 was alerting us on K band.<br>Sorry for long review but Scott You Are Wrong!! In two weeks the R7 probably saved me from a couple of tickets at just a bit over.<br>Max 360 is really good and I like some of its features but its K band range doesn't come close to the R7, I think its over filtered, K band is still out there guys!<br>Arrows are a must as I have had several detectors without them but I will never go back to no Arrows.<br>The R7 switches from front to side to rear faster than the Max 360 but not a deal breaker but so far very impressed with R7!!!<br>Need more time with the R7 but Max 360 currently has saved me over the last year at least 10 times but one ticket on Lidar that was my fault because I didn't react fast enough as it actually gave me a enough time but I was too busy ignoring it.<br>Thanks to Vortex but be careful of band segmentation as I had several readings outside of segmentation on both bands and I don't want to go to court to argue these readings. I run wide on all K and KA bands just to be safe and the R7 still has great range.<br>Lots of K and KA over the last Year so don't believe Scott the lazy cops use RADAR not Lidar!!!<br>Oh and the County Cops coming at you in the oncoming lanes almost always have their RADAR on!<br>Good luck and if you don't have a RADAR detector don't go over 5mph over speed limit or you will get a Ticket!! </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROGYSAYISVXJ1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PJ2ZX6R","rating":5,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019","utc":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"robert gorman","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTJLCB2ID6XJP2CPQFBAYJUS3SA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AFTJLCB2ID6XJP2CPQFBAYJUS3SA"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":228,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R30YOQIANZT1I1","title":"Better then the R3?","body":"I currently own an R3 and bought this R7 for my 2nd vehicle.

weeks now and pretty impressed with this radar detector mainly after experience documented below: A) The response time of police radar from both sides (left & right) is pretty fast on this radar and it gives me warning from almost 1 to 1 and a half mile away from the source which gives me more than ample time to slow down. This detector in past few weeks of usage have given me 5 to 6 warnings at various times which is truly the best feature and justified investing in this product in the first place. B) Apart from the crisp radar detection, this is an A grade dash cam as well suitable for both day time and night time usage. So due to this what it does is it fulfils the 2 targets with 1 arrow: 1) Acting as a radar detector and 2) Acting as a vehicle dash cam and both are equally critical aspects when driving in today's day and age and that was also 1 of the core reasons I invested in this product for long term purpose. It keeps on recording in loop and overwrites the past video so I do not have the hassle of removing memory card and deleting videos and such sort of activities. C) This device has some intelligent features bundled in it and 1 of them in particular which my family was genuinely impressed with was it's intelligent gesture control feature where during the times our baby is in the back child seat, I just have to hold a gesture movement in front of it for it to understand that it should not prompt voice commands so that no disturbance is caused while the baby is sleeping. Very intelligent thought process implemented behind this feature in particular. D) BONUS: This device came in with pre-installed 32 GB memory card which was a nice bonus and saved me extra purchase of the micro-sd memory card and besides in long term, I might be able to upgrade the memory upto 128 GB card too as this device supports upto that much capacity which is impressive. E) Its lenses on the dash cam are able to capture wide array of coverage outside and thereby gives me adequate coverage area to record and what this does it, in case of future mishap like an accident or a fender bender from the left or right side of my vehicle, if the opposite vehicle is at the fault, I will have a very clear evidence captured and documented by this dash cam. F) The display of this device on my end is pretty broad and more than enough for me to clearly view controls, set-up controls and be in control of the device at all times while the vehicle is being driven and it helps me with not getting distracted while driving as I am able to clearly view what is going on on the display while I am driving. Ultimately, a long term investment to remain focused on roads while driving and it well worth the cost.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> Have been using it for few weeks now and pretty impressed with this radar detector mainly after experience documented below:<br>A) The response time of police radar from both sides (left &amp; right) is pretty fast on this radar and it gives me warning from almost 1 to 1 and a half mile away from the source which gives me more than ample time to slow down.

INCLUDED MAGNETIC MOUNT - Our new Radenso magnetic quick-release suction cup mount makes mounting your detector a snap. Take it down at night to protect against theft or purchase a second mount to quickly swap between vehicles. The strong magnet holds the DS1 secure over even the largest bumps or fastest corners. EXTREME LONG RANGE & AUTO GPS LOCKOUTS - Radenso DS1 has been proved by third party testers to have the highest range of any radar detector. Combined with automatic GPS lockouts for stationary false alerts makes the Radenso DS1 the top radar detector.","attributes":[{"name":"Brand","value":"Radenso"},{"name":"Compatible Devices","value":"Android, Mac OS, Windows"},{"name":"Frequency Bands Supported","value":"X, K, Ka, Laser, MultaRadar (MRCT, MRCT), Gatso"},{"name":"Power Source","value":"DC"},{"name":"Display Type","value":"OLED"},{"name":"Voltage","value":"12 Volts (DC)"}],"top_reviews":[{"id":"R1FGZDT4AFKUWW","title":"Out-performs every other detector--easily--and doesn't annoy you","body":"I'm a medical courier, and I badly needed a radar detector--a really good one. I tried the Whistler CR-95 but it was inconsistent in its GPS database for photo radar, which is a big problem in the area where I drive. After heavy research, I realized the Radensos are a breed apart, and I settled on the DS1, mainly for the protection feature it has for mobile police radar vans, aka Multaradar--a new type of radar being used against unsuspecting motorists. The DS1 is relatively small, lightweight compared to other detectors I've tried. It won't stay put if you try to use a dash pad on the dash; it will roll and tumble with every turn of your wheel. The magnetic mount that comes with the detector works extremely well on my windshield. I have the detector mounted one inch below my rear view mirror. The detector has a corner cut on the left side where the mute button is located. That makes it very easy to reach up and mute the detector tho this detector is far more quiet out-of-the box than any other detector I've tried. My first night of trial, I was driving to one of my stops in Buckeye AZ. As I drove down Yuma Road for 5 miles plus in the dark, a straight arrow to the shopping center, the detector was beeping Ka band radar like crazy but I could not see anything; it was dark outside. I kept my speed close to 50. There were two lanes each direction, very little traffic. I've driven this street many times before in the dark at faster speeds. Tonight tho, the detector was extremely active on a dark deserted road. The Ka band is blaring--that's police radar. And the K band is going--it can be police or other sources but there's nothing around me. I'm in the last town on the outskirts of Phoenix, and the radar detector is going insane at 10:00 pm on a dark, empty street?! Weird, really weird. Then, the Waze app announces: \"Police ahead in 0.50 miles\" or something like that. So, the detector gave me several miles notice of a cop who is now ½ mile in front of me. As I get closer, I see an SUV vehicle on the left side facing towards me, sitting in the dark. The detector is screaming at me: KA BAND!!!. I drive by and see the POLICE decal. He is using a mounted radar gun to pick off anybody who speeds down Yuma Road, and, amazingly, he just leaves the radar on. That's how you do it: Waze + the world class Radenso DS1 radar detector. No ticket tonight. On the previous Saturday, in Scottsdale, Waze alerted me to all the photo radar intersections regardless whether the cameras were actually installed or pointed at my lanes. But the detector was choosy: If there were no cameras pointed at my three lanes, it stayed silent. Returning the other way, the photo radar cameras were pointed at my three lanes, and the detector alerted me, in addition to Waze. For photo radar, the DS1 detector uses an installed GPS database (firmware download). Why have both? Waze is unreliable for mobile police vans equipped with the new Multaradar speed camera. The new equipment uses infrared cameras that don't require a flash to capture your license plate. They use a new type of radar that flips between bands that today's radar detectors cannot detect unless you're using a Radenso DS1 or Pro M. I've seen one such van up on the curb in Scottsdale; I'm not sure what my speed was when I drove past it, and Waze didn't warn me of the mobile van. Waze also cannot fore-warn you if you are driving through an Internet hole--an area with a weak Internet connection. The DS1 costs more than I wanted to spend but less than a traffic ticket plus court fees. No regrets here.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> I'm a medical courier, and I badly needed a radar detector--a really good one.

Radenso’s support is mostly second to none as well. One can speak to a live person when calling and they follow-up promptly with support tickets. I’m more than a little disappointed that it wasn’t clear in the description that the Bluetooth does not work with iPhones. Sadly, I’m sending the detector back.

Hope this review helps. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MMN9M6NORFYS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07C2RNRCJ","rating":4,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2018","utc":"2018-03-11T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Rachael Fairbairn","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPMA6VKYPIKSKXU43BSNAYUZHRQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AFPMA6VKYPIKSKXU43BSNAYUZHRQ"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":800,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R2P9KUYPCGL6XK","title":"I LOVE this seat","body":"I LOVE this seat.

Pampers, do yourself a favor and be kind to your customers. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIHPVHP3XKSHI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07DC8BR3B","rating":2,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2018","utc":"2018-09-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Becca","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPB4A7J5UY2YND34OZM7NXNP24A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AGPB4A7J5UY2YND34OZM7NXNP24A"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":89,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R3DT3EBQB7PM6V","title":"DO NOT BUY! The new design leaks like crazy.","body":"I recently purchased a box of these pampers swaddlers (size 2 - 186 count) and have been using them for the last few days. At first we thought these were not authentic pampers as they are drastically different than what we normally get from pampers swaddlers (ie, the fit around her legs is different, the absorbency is horrible, the tabs seem different ect). I reached out to pampers and these are authentic. They have redesigned the pampers swaddlers to be softer and to include a woodland theme design. The name has also been changed to pampers swaddlers Active Baby. Ever since we started using the new design, my 8 month old is constantly leaking urine and stool out of her diaper regardless of how often we changed her. They leak out through the legs and through the diaper itself. For example, we changed her just before leaving my sister's place yesterday and when we got home 30 minutes later, we discovered that she leaked all over her brand new carseat. We still have a few diapers from her last box (old design and same size 2) that we put on to compare and they work perfectly. They fit comfortably and there is absolutely no leaking whatsoever. If this new design is completely replacing the old design that we have loved since day 1, I think we are going to have to try out a different pampers line (ie. Pampers baby dry) or even possibly a different brand all together.

That being said- i should have went up another size. I ordered 12 month thinking she would be in them a while but they fit her nicely now so it won’t be long until she’s grown out of them. One other downside to these- i washed them once (delicate cycle in washer and dryer), before she wore any of them, and while putting the red one with the big Minnie on her, noticed a hole right at the seam down by the buttons. An easy fix with a needle and some thread- but it is inconvenient and irritating since she had literally never worn it and it already has a hole.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> Ordered the Minnie Mouse set for my 8 month old- they are super cute, I love them and she def loves them- especially the ones with the big pictures of Minnie.

Named One of the Best Books of the Year by The Guardian “McConaughey’s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he did - and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.” (Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck) I’ve been in this life for 50 years, been trying to work out its riddle for 42, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last 35. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.” So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It’s a love letter. To life. It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green, too. Good luck.","main_image":{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DZeZw7K0L.jpg"},"is_bundle":false,"attributes":[{"name":"variant","value":"Audiobook"}],"top_reviews":[{"id":"R16OWAN9AYB7HI","title":"Insulting statement","body":"All races matter.

Kind of a mashup of Anthony Bourdain with Ernest Hemingway, McConaughey tells stories with the aplomb of accomplished raconteur. Part memoir, part life guide and part ethic Greenlights is worth reading for many beyond McConaughey’s fan base; basically anyone who likes a good man’s man adventure story. Born into the lower middle class in East Texas, McConaughey looks back nostalgically at a childhood few would envy. His parents divorced and remarried each other twice, he was subject to corporal punishment and money was always an issue. Yet he doesn’t complain about disadvantage. In fact he honors his parents despite their shortcomings. He adheres to a philosophy of choosing to recalibrate what seems like the inevitable until it turns into a green light or way forward in life. After a rite of passage involving brawling with a barroom bouncer, McConaughey pursued acting with the drive and hard work ethic that was instilled into him. Finding early success, he choose to live in a way directly opposite to the Hollywood scene. Traveling the country with his dog, going off on expeditions to the middle of Africa and South America, McConaughey sees livin (drop the g to indicate it’s always a verb) as more than just the material success and creature comforts many of us settle on. Finally, after years of womanizing, McConaughey settled into a successful monogamous relationship and fulfilled his life long ambition of being a father. Nearly simultaneously he chose to walk away from lucrative rom-coms to focus on something more artistic. Initially successful in winning an Oscar for the Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey admits that he hasn’t achieved the popular success he envisioned. But that is all grist for the mill, experiments in livin that are ongoing. If this is the kind of man you would like to read about, Greenlights will be an enjoyable and inspirational read. It’s rare that a successful actor has such a distinctive off air personality. But if you’re turned off by physical conflict, wild adventures and a man who brags about rarely showering alone than Greenlights is not for you. Personally, while not finding all parts of McConaughey’s biography admirable, I found enough of him to be so different than what Hollywood typically churns out that the book was worth reading. Recommended to all who feel they’re similarly traveling in unmapped regions and want to gather around the campfire to hear a fellow wanderer’s tales.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> Greenlights is a remarkable first book from an already renowned artist.

wryly funny and surprisingly moving account of an extraordinary life lived almost entirely in the public eye. A teen idol at 15, an international icon and founder of the Brat Pack at 20, and one of Hollywood's top stars to this day, Rob Lowe chronicles his experiences as a painfully misunderstood child actor in Ohio who was uprooted to the wild counterculture of mid-'70s Malibu, where he embarked on his unrelenting pursuit of a career in Hollywood.  The Outsiders placed Lowe at the birth of the modern youth movement in the entertainment industry. During his time on The West Wing, he witnessed the surreal nexus of show business and politics, both on the set and in the actual White House. And in between are deft and humorous stories of the wild excesses that marked the '80s, leading to his quest for family and sobriety.  Never mean-spirited or salacious, Lowe delivers unexpected glimpses into his successes, disappointments, relationships, and one-of-a-kind encounters with people who shaped our world over the last 25 years. These stories are as entertaining as they are unforgettable.","main_image":{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51U2b1VTRxL.jpg"},"is_bundle":false,"attributes":[{"name":"variant","value":"Audiobook"}],"top_reviews":[{"id":"R1MZWMF1CKHF0W","title":"I think anyone who reads this book will have a new appreciation for who Rob Lowe really is and smile because of it.","body":"STORIES I ONLY TELL MY FRIENDS by Rob Lowe is a memoir of Rob Lowe life from childhood thru to right after he finished his work on The West Wing.

His family was a mess, especially his mother, and while he doesn't say it straight that acting was a way to escape his family and lose himself in focusing on his craft, it is certainly implied. As many of the better celebrity memoirs are, Lowe make a point of saying that no matter how hard you work at acting and how good you are, there is always some luck involved. Lowe worked hard and made sure as he had as many opportunities for luck as possible. He also writes in awe of many of his experiences, as if he still can't believe some of the things that have happened to him. I think my favorite was he was working with James Cameron to act in a movie that Lowe wrote and was to direct (it never came to be).

In her brutally honest, hilarious, heartbreaking memoir, she reveals what was going on behind the scenes of her sometimes tumultuous personal and professional life - a story she’s never shared, until now. Of the medium she loves, the one that made her a household name, she says, “Television can put you in a box; the flat-screen can flatten. On TV, you are larger than life but smaller, too. It is not the whole story, and it is not the whole me. This book is.\" Beginning in early childhood, Couric was inspired by her journalist father to pursue the career he loved but couldn’t afford to stay in. Balancing her vivacious, outgoing personality with her desire to be taken seriously, she overcame every obstacle in her way: insecurity, an eating disorder, being typecast, sexism...challenges, and how she dealt with them, setting the tone for the rest of her career. Couric talks candidly about adjusting to sudden fame after her astonishing rise to co-anchor of the Today show, and guides us through the most momentous events and news stories of the era, to which she had a front-row seat: Rodney King, Anita Hill, Columbine, the death of Princess Diana, 9/11, the Iraq War.... In every instance, she relentlessly pursued the facts, ruffling more than a few feathers along the way. She also recalls in vivid and sometimes lurid detail the intense pressure on female anchors to snag the latest “get” - often sensational tabloid stories like Jon Benet Ramsey, Tonya Harding, and OJ Simpson. Couric’s position as one of the leading lights of her profession was shadowed by the shock and trauma of losing her husband to stage 4 colon cancer when he was just 42, leaving her a widow and single mom to two daughters, six and two. The death of her sister Emily, just three years later, brought yet more trauma - and an unwavering commitment to cancer awareness and research, one of her proudest accomplishments. Couric is unsparing in the details of her historic move to the anchor chair at the CBS Evening News - a world rife with sexism and misogyny. Her “welcome” was even more hostile at 60 Minutes, an unrepentant boys club that engaged in outright hazing of even the most established women. In the wake of the MeToo movement, Couric shares her clear-eyed reckoning with gender inequality and predatory behavior in the workplace, and downfall of Matt Lauer - a colleague she had trusted and respected for more than a decade. Couric also talks about the challenge of finding love again, with all the hilarity, false-starts, and drama that search entailed, before finding her midlife Mr. Right. Something she has never discussed publicly - why her second marriage almost didn’t happen.  If you thought you knew Katie Couric, think again. Going There is the fast-paced, emotional, riveting story of a thoroughly modern woman, whose journey took her from humble origins to superstardom. In this book, you will find a friend, a confidante, a role model, a survivor whose lessons about life will enrich your own.

This book makes clear she is far more an entertainer than she is a journalist. In this memoir, what she cares most about in life are the things of entertainment--money, celebrity, and standing out in a crowd, especially a crowd of VIPs. She's certainly a savvy self-promoter and competent as a tv newsperson (the Sarah Palin moment showed the rewards from persistent questioning that we always need more of.) But she doesn't come across as actually \"smart\", because--for all the opportunities she's had, she regards it all so trivially. Has she learned anything meaningful from her apparently rich experiences? It doesn't seem so from \"Going There\" which she says expresses her real self. She was, from the beginning, well suited to television: cute, and an extrovert with a great smile. Yes, she succeeded in a male-dominated field, but she seems to have played the game to do it. She has an off-putting double standard for men and women. She seems loath to criticize bad behavior in famous men, giving sort of a wink or a shrug to much of it in those she mentions (Sam Donaldson, Larry King, even Matt Lauer. Dinner with Jeffrey Epstein doesn't mean much other than to archly note how her boyfriend pointed out \"how young\" the women were. And how young were they? She doesn't say, or seem upset by being even tangentially part of his world.) Most people who knew her from the Today Show remember how mean she was to Ann Curry who, by comparison to Couric, always seemed genuine. I never understood it--Curry, professional, beautiful, reserved--seemed no threat to Katie's dominance on \"Today\". But in this memoir, you can see she's just kind of mean to other women. It's no wonder that one of the young women Lauer abused told Curry (who reported it), but didn't tell Couric. What woman would trust Katie with something like that? Here, she seems to criticize Lauer just as much as she has to, while often blaming his victims for not being as strong and assertive as Katie is. She publishes her emails to Lauer--and his to her. Also shares private emails to her from others, also apparently without their permission. Another Mean Girl move.) She's still mean to Curry here, repeating a \"joke\" Katie made at a Lauer roast even though she knew it hurt and humiliated Curry then. So let's do it again, for all time, in a book. (It was, btw, crude and unfunny even then.) She was hostile when Ashleigh Banfield got hired because Banfield was smart, pretty, and younger than Katie. She gets in digs at Deborah Norville, whom she permanently replaced when Norville went on maternity leave, for supposedly being unrelatable to viewers because of being so perfect. (It sounds like a compliment here. From Katie, it's not.) She snits about Martha Stewart not having a sense of humor until she went to prison. And on it goes. She doesn't mentor anyone because what if they're better than she is? Even at CBS News, making top dollar at $15 mill a year, she has to still be the mean girl, head of the pack. She even felt threatened when her husband, a lawyer, became a legal analyst on television. \"He should stay in his lane,\" she thought. (Yes, she eventually tuned in to his illness and suggests she blames herself. But is it a pose or real remorse? With Katie, she discloses a lot of unflattering things, but her real feelings about them are hard to tell. And, yes, she's done good work to educate people about colorectal cancer and screenings. She does charitable cancer work. That's commendable, but also benefits her public image, which seems never far from her mind. Too harsh? Maybe. Maybe not. What really put me off wasn't all her digs at other famous women. It was the way she took out after her daughter's nanny. She used a different name, but the real name is out now as the woman felt she needed to defend herself. Couric wrote such insulting descriptions of her (a woman who was basically \"co-parenting\" with her for three years, but who Couric concludes had developed an \"unhealthy\" role in the household, \"making\" Couric abnormally dependent on her.) It's all kind of weird, unflattering to both, but particularly to the nanny who, in interviews, has said much of it wasn't true, and has supplied her own unflattering descriptions of Katie. Be that as it may, the nanny isn't a public figure with a best-selling book that millions will read and believe. It's a vintage mean girl move from Couric, but not surprising. As she often comes across here, Couric's self-centered, competitive, intellectually shallow, vain, petty and really -not- much of a \"sweetheart\".Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height: none; height: 300px;\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\"> <span> Yes, Katie Couric has had an accomplished career, as entertainer and in tv journalism. This book makes clear she is far more an entertainer than she is a journalist. In this memoir, what she cares most about in life are the things of entertainment--money, celebrity, and standing out in a crowd, especially a crowd of VIPs. She's certainly a savvy self-promoter and competent as a tv newsperson (the Sarah Palin moment showed the rewards from persistent questioning that we always need more of.)<br><br>But she doesn't come across as actually \"smart\", because--for all the opportunities she's had, she regards it all so trivially. Has she learned anything meaningful from her apparently rich experiences? It doesn't seem so from \"Going There\" which she says expresses her real self.<br><br>She was, from the beginning, well suited to television: cute, and an extrovert with a great smile. Yes, she succeeded in a male-dominated field, but she seems to have played the game to do it. She has an off-putting double standard for men and women. She seems loath to criticize bad behavior in famous men, giving sort of a wink or a shrug to much of it in those she mentions (Sam Donaldson, Larry King, even Matt Lauer. Dinner with Jeffrey Epstein doesn't mean much other than to archly note how her boyfriend pointed out \"how young\" the women were. And how young were they? She doesn't say, or seem upset by being even tangentially part of his world.)<br><br>Most people who knew her from the Today Show remember how mean she was to Ann Curry who, by comparison to Couric, always seemed genuine.

I know readers will be surprised, entertained, and even shocked at what’s in store.\" (Andy Cohen) Dave Quinn's Not All Diamonds and Rosé is the definitive oral history of the hit television franchise The Real Housewives, from its unlikely start in the gated communities of Orange County to the pop culture behemoth it has become - spanning nine cities, hundreds of cast members, and millions of fans. What is it really like to be a housewife? We all want to know, but only the women we love to watch and the people who make the show have the whole story. Well, listen in close, because they’re about to tell all. Nearly all the wives, producers, and network executives, as well as Andy Cohen himself, are on the record, unfiltered and unvarnished about what it really takes to have a tagline. This is your VIP pass to the lives behind the glam squads, testimonials, and tabloid feuds. Life’s not all diamonds and rosé, but the truth is so much better, isn’t it? PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.","main_image":{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41XwFia6bJL.jpg"},"is_bundle":false,"attributes":[{"name":"variant","value":"Audiobook"}],"top_reviews":[{"id":"R3MYS9KJFFE6F5","title":"A Biased Mess","body":"Ehhh this was a miss for me.

performance, graphics, and productivity in a flexible device, the Lenovo Flex 5 14 14-inch laptop is built to be what you need it to be. Proudly powered by AMD Ryzen™ 5000 Series mobile processors with integrated AMD Radeon™ Graphics, the Flex 5 14 has a 360⁰ hinge and touchscreen display, making it easy to watch, work, and create to your heart's content. Reduce the clutter with four-sided narrow bezels for more viewing area on the FHD IPS panel. Plus, with a 12-hour battery* with Quick Charge, this slim and lightweight laptop is your ideal travel companion, whether you're working at the coffee shop or flying across the country.\n\nThe Flex 5 14 is a 2-in-1 laptop that's made to be used the way you want. Flip the hinge and use the touchscreen in \"tablet\" mode to take notes, draw, or interact with the computer in intuitive ways. Fold it into the familiar \"laptop\" mode for everyday computing and productivity tasks. Put your convertible laptop in \"tent\" mode to share photos, videos, or documents so everyone can see your full HD screen. Or flip it into \"stand\" mode to watch your favorite streaming movies and shows. This easy-to-use laptop also comes with Windows 11 Home, a backlit keyboard, a webcam privacy shutter, and a fingerprint reader.\n\n* All battery life claims are approximate and based on results using the MobileMark® 2014 battery life benchmark test. Actual battery life will vary and depends on many factors such as product configuration and usage, software use, wireless functionality, power management settings, and screen brightness. The maximum capacity of the battery will decrease with time and use.","a_plus_content":{"has_a_plus_content":true,"has_brand_story":false,"third_party":true},"sub_title":{"text":"Visit the Lenovo Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/stores/LENOVO/page/2C6395BA-C701-4025-9D7E-BAE1BD647EEE?ref_=ast_bln"},"amazons_choice":{"keywords":"in Traditional Laptop Computers by Lenovo"},"rating":4.5,"rating_breakdown":{"five_star":{"percentage":80,"count":62},"four_star":{"percentage":8,"count":6},"three_star":{"percentage":4,"count":3},"two_star":{"percentage":2,"count":1},"one_star":{"percentage":6,"count":4}},"ratings_total":78,"reviews_total":78,"main_image":{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zZiQGzc5L.jpg"},"images":[{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zZiQGzc5L._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"MAIN"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818B97p+vcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT01"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QjZ06DaFL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT02"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WcP2tg9BL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT03"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k58VtLUXL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT04"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ji9RvCfXL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT05"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Skp3WsDUL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT06"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IUcTEIYbL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT07"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZtENkaviL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT08"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718puVDixnL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT09"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MgsefcZzS._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT10"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EVi6koAVL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT11"}],"images_count":12,"is_bundle":false,"feature_bullets":["Powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U mobile processor with Radeon graphics, this portable notebook computer has 16GB DDR4 RAM and 256GB NVMe SSD Storage","Reduce the clutter - The Flex 5 14 touchscreen laptop has a narrow bezel on 4 sides for more viewing area and less clutter on the IPS FHD (1920 x 1080) display","Designed to keep your ideas flowing, anywhere, anytime with the ability to multi-mode, this Windows laptop has a 360⁰ hinge so you can use it in laptop mode for everyday computing, tent mode for sharing, stand mode for binge-watching your favorite streaming shows, or tablet mode for easy interaction","A physical shutter on the webcam improves your privacy, allowing you to keep out unwanted attention","Stay connected with integrated 2x2 WiFi 6 (802.11AX), Bluetooth 5, 2 USB-A ports, 1 USB-C with PD to support power charging, HDMI, a 4-in-1 card reader, and an audio jack","Includes free 3-month trial of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Play over 100 high-quality PC games on Windows PC; includes iconic Bethesda games, new day one titles, and the EA Play on PC catalog"],"feature_bullets_count":6,"feature_bullets_flat":"Includes free 3-month trial of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Play over 100 high-quality PC games on Windows PC; includes iconic Bethesda games, new day one titles, and the EA Play on PC catalog.

I wouldn't expect to play games at the highest settings but for it's price point it makes sense. I didn't think I'd be using the touchscreen as much as I thought. It is super smooth like you'd expect a high end tablet. The keyboard is easy to get used to. I'm used to a full size keyboard but I don't really miss it so that's a great sign. It's really easy to switch between tent mode, tablet mode, or laptop mode. 2 USB ports is kind of limiting. The pen works really well. The plastic piece that attaches to the USB port is really cheap feeling and doesn't hold the pen upright (even though there's a hole on top as if it's supposed to) but it's not a big deal. Out of the box it doesn't seem to be as smooth as the lens like from the Samsung tab S7 plus, but I'm sure it just takes some messing with the settings. The battery life is really good. I'd say it's on par with laptops. You could get by almost the whole day without charging and if you need to, it charges pretty quickly.

My only complaint, which is probably my fault, is that the computer screen is a bit too small and is hard to see at times. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IJYKTBLAIA0M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09BG96KFJ","rating":3,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022","utc":"2022-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Lauren J.","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFJISHI2H7ZQERYH754SJF2MAIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AEFJISHI2H7ZQERYH754SJF2MAIA"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":2,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R3FACUA09H2BK8","title":"Keeps crashing during my online teaching job.","body":"Can't keep strong wifi signal and freezes/crashes while I am trying to do my online jobRead more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\"> <span> Can't keep strong wifi signal and freezes/crashes while I am trying to do my online job </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FACUA09H2BK8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09BG96KFJ","rating":2,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022","utc":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Sondra","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQCCA4RRUTTJ3TWFF3DGUHMVF3A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AHQCCA4RRUTTJ3TWFF3DGUHMVF3A"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":6,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R25PMX87WZVD5P","title":"Great Device!

Never really liked the chromebook so I thought I'd try a MS book instead. All I use it for is streaming and some news. This G7 has a nice heft to it and feels solid. It has a quality feel. I like the 12g ram and the 1080p display. I like the backlit keyboard and the screen size. The keyboard has a nice tactile feel to it. The processor is a little stronger than others which I felt was an issue with the chromebook so I upped my purchase to the G7 to get the 5100. The power cord is short but I used the C connector since that cord is a lot longer and it seemed to work. The big downfall is the battery life. Last night I charged it to 100% and listened to a radio stream for about 20 minutes....no video. Shut it down...which logs off the computer...and went to sleep. Woke up and started browsing. I've been on for about 2-2.5 hours and done nothing but read static text sites...news sites...yahoo, etc and the battery is below 60%. With less than 3 hours viewing on a full charge and absolutely no video, the battery sits at 59%. I have screen brightness set to less than half and it's running on battery saver full time. I must have gotten a dud battery because 10000 mh should last longer. Streaming video makes it drop like a rock. 20 minutes of streaming took 10% of the battery. It's a shame it's going back because it's a nice laptop otherwise. I liked most everything about the GT except the battery. Sent it back an got another...same problem. One issue is that their website says the GT has a 5000 mah battery and the doc that came with the computer says 5000 mah but the info on the Amazon site says 10000. With that said, everything else stacks up. I like all the features about the laptop so I just adjusted and kept the second. Disabling bluetooth and notifications along with microsoft 'lock manager' (???) gives me a decent run on a charge plus I didn't care about those other features anyway.

Anyway, I was sold on it and purchased one.<br> I just needed to replace my 17\" laptop &amp; 14\" was as small as I wanted to go. I have an 11\" tablet -- very nice but too too small! With this machine I think I have found what I need -- easy to see, to read, the keyboard is way better than the old laptop, suits my hand size &amp; it lights up, I am not a touch typist, strictly two fingers!<br> At the end of the day I have just what I want, within my buget. I am well pleased. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NZRMSZ26BRY5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09NN24ZY9","rating":5,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2021","utc":"2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"J.

Never really liked the chromebook so I thought I'd try a MS book instead. All I use it for is streaming and some news. This G7 has a nice heft to it and feels solid. It has a quality feel.

The processor is a little stronger than others which I felt was an issue with the chromebook so I upped my purchase to the G7 to get the 5100. The power cord is short but I used the C connector since that cord is a lot longer and it seemed to work. The big downfall is the battery life. Last night I charged it to 100% and listened to a radio stream for about 20 minutes....no video. Shut it down...which logs off the computer...and went to sleep. Woke up and started browsing. I've been on for about 2-2.5 hours and done nothing but read static text sites...news sites...yahoo, etc and the battery is below 60%. With less than 3 hours viewing on a full charge and absolutely no video, the battery sits at 59%. I have screen brightness set to less than half and it's running on battery saver full time. I must have gotten a dud battery because 10000 mh should last longer. Streaming video makes it drop like a rock. 20 minutes of streaming took 10% of the battery. It's a shame it's going back because it's a nice laptop otherwise. I liked most everything about the GT except the battery. Sent it back an got another...same problem. One issue is that their website says the GT has a 5000 mah battery and the doc that came with the computer says 5000 mah but the info on the Amazon site says 10000. With that said, everything else stacks up. I like all the features about the laptop so I just adjusted and kept the second. Disabling bluetooth and notifications along with microsoft 'lock manager' (???) gives me a decent run on a charge plus I didn't care about those other features anyway.

When I first opened the packaging that contained the bag, I was pleasantly surprised as to how big a medium duffel bag actually is. There is plenty of room for clothes, extra shoes, bottles, balls, etc. in this bag. The bag for me is actually too big, but it is fine for everything I need, so it is not a complaint. In fact, I am still able to fit this bag into a small locker, as it can be smashed down to fit in small compartments. I recommend getting this size because it can fit everything I need comfortably and more if needed. I have no problem throwing it in the back seat on the ground of my car, so transporting it is no problem at all. For functionality, it works very well, as not only does the main compartment have all the space needed, the extra compartments are nice if you are designating them for clothes, keys, or shoes. Although not a feature of the bag, I will give credit to the durability of the bag. The material is premium and has not shown any fading of any sort.

Set up collar receiver \nBefore first using our Rechargeable and Waterproof Collar Receiver please make sure charging it at least 4 hours. Turning on the power button on the receiver and the red LED light will turn on. When the indicator light turns flashing red it means battery is running down and needs to be recharged. \n2. Correction system \n1. Pre-correction warning tone: when the dog reaches the edge of the signal field it will hear a warning tone that lasts about two seconds. If the dog does not return to the safe area it will receive a continuous correction by warning tone static shock until it returns to the safe area. \n2. Run-through prevention: the receiver automatically increases the correction as the dog enters the signal field. The dog cannot “run through” the signal field without receiving strong correction.","sub_title":{"text":"Brand: Blingbling Petsfun","link":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_dp_s_web_0?ie=UTF8&search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Blingbling+Petsfun"},"rating":4.8,"rating_breakdown":{"five_star":{"percentage":82,"count":50},"four_star":{"percentage":18,"count":11},"three_star":{"percentage":0,"count":0},"two_star":{"percentage":0,"count":0},"one_star":{"percentage":0,"count":0}},"ratings_total":62,"reviews_total":62,"main_image":{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SMXybK4HL.jpg"},"images":[{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SMXybK4HL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"MAIN"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810tCQP65fL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT01"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B7BCuB8DL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT02"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Pi0RvZ7xL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT03"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tIfHSljLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT04"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cg9NJ-ZfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT05"},{"link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cRjFECFpL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","variant":"PT06"}],"images_count":7,"is_bundle":false,"feature_bullets":["【⭐2-DOG PET WIRELESS FENCE SYSTEM】Suitable for 2 Dogs System.

What a great wireless dog fence system. Easy to set up and works as described. I was worrying because we moved to a new house and there is no fence around, and I have a high-energy boxer mix (70 lbs). I read the reviews and all the materials before installing or training. this fence took me a few hours to set up, I set the receiver and measured the boundary holding a collar and listening for the beeps. It took only once or twice of going beyond the boundary for them to figure it out. We are on our third day of training, and I take them outside 3-4 times a day and walk the boundary and praise them. They are a little freaked out after being shocked a couple of times, but I've been feeding them cheese while we are outside and squeaking a toy, and they seem happy and stick close to me. I hope with positive reinforcement they will start relaxing a bit more when in the yard. It's been wonderful not having to mess with leashes when I take them out to do their business. My big dog barked at a neighbor this morning and started running towards him, but I said \"no\" loudly and he stopped short of the flags without getting shocked.

Also - if you put it on a fence, the dog will easily learn quickly. If you put it through the yard, it's confusing to dogs and they might just be stressed and not use the full area. Also - DON'T USE 24/7. Instructions say to avoid using more than 12 hours a day. If you never take these off, the dog's neck with get sores and then you'll be out of use until they heal. We know from experience! We don't always take them off at night, but we do try to give them more nights without them than with them on. It gives them a break and I'm sure they don't land on the same exact spot when we put them back on each day. Our dogs come into the garage at night, but are outside dogs. I recommend you consider the same plan if you use a shock collar of any kind. There are a lot of settings. If you don't read about how to use these, you may return them thinking they don't work at all. Learn how to turn them on, how to set the shock intensity, and how to set the boundary space (how far from the wire it alerts/shocks the dog). Depending on your yard size and dog attitude, you'll want to find the right setting for each of those things. I like the flashing green light when it's charged, and flashing red when I need to charge it. The batteries last a long time. We're very happy with our purchase. We have two big dogs (90 & 110 lbs) and these work great at less than ½ the intensity. So PLEASE get these but read the instructions and start at the lowest level... Only moving up if needed. Level 4 makes my 110 pound dog jump up in the air and bark. So please don't assume your stubborn dog needs full intensity (4 is not the highest setting!).

While working on his training, preventing him from disappearing into the woods has been a bit of a challenge. We take him to the dog park to blow off steam but that's not always an option. We have been looking into physical fencing of all types but for the amount of free space we'd like to provide him it is cost prohibitive. I began researching the invisible fences and ordered this product. Installation was quite simple. The yard is large and surrounded on 3 sides by woods with entrances to a few paths. We used up the 1000' of provided wiring and I picked up another 500' of the 20 gauge invisible fence wire from the local home improvement store. We looped nearly 1500 feet of wire around the perimeter of the yard. As luck would have it, we had a crack running across the driveway at around the halfway point between the house and the road that we laid the wire in and filled it with driveway repair goop. For the rest of the yard, I used the edger attachment on my weed whacker to cut trenches where needed and buried the wire. Instead of burying all of it, we used landscaping staples to secure the wire under the bushes and brush around the perimeter. I understand that nature should do the rest. Finally, I used a drill to twist the wires that cross through the containment area and ran it into the garage where the transmitter is installed. We set the transmitter to trigger the collar at about 5' away from the wire. The collar is set to the lowest level (2), which my wife and I tried on our arms to see what it felt like - a very minor, uncomfortable tickle. With everything tested out, flags planted and collar charged up it was time to train. We walked the leashed dog around the perimeter a couple of times. Along the way, we would stop at random flags and say \"no!\", walk him past the flags to trigger the warning beep and say \"no!\" and once walked close enough to the wire to trigger the static. That's all it took. I thought we'd be following the training guide for a month but it doesn't matter if he's chasing birds, rabbits, balls, the kids or our other dog - he will not go anywhere near any of the flags. It he's leashed and we get close to the flags he stops and lays down.

The other day my husky was standing in the kitchen minding her own business and it started to go off and i could not catch her as she was running away. The collar stayed on for almost a full minute before stopping the shock.<br>This is not safe and the company needs to be held responsible. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16YU5H5YTIMHE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07R3GSW5B","rating":1,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020","utc":"2020-08-03T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"Joshua swanson","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG4FGH5XLYBW3HXL7NYLTYV3JDKQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AG4FGH5XLYBW3HXL7NYLTYV3JDKQ"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"helpful_votes":21,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"R3P93GPR4X6JX4","title":"Works like a charm","body":"Little labor goes a long way.

It loaded, it ran, then trying to reboot, it just locks up. Will try a remove and reinstall. Happens with this and the Business version. It appears as if some SW designer just wants to add SW burdens on the tax issue. These folks seem to be getting worse by the year. There may be some upgrade before the tax filing deadline but I am not counting on it. So BEWARE if you try to get this early version. I will update as I waste more time on this rather defective tool. UPDATE 1: I managed to have a Restore Point in W10 as well as back up Registry files. After 6 hours of using the Restore Point process I got the machine back to the day before the fatal install. The problem seems to be, still a guess, that TT 2021 does not like seeing TT 2020 or TT 2019 which I had on the machine. I loaded this on a second machine without TTs from previous years and it worked. Now not everyone has the time and experience to go through this process and TT should never have released such a weak product in my opinion. Will update as we progress. UPDATE 2: Reloaded TT 2021 Personal and it updated smoothly. However I still have TT 2020 and 2019 on the old machine and I am fearful of uninstalling since it clearly impacts the Registry entries. My suggestion is let sleeping dogs lie and one a machine is Restored, it will still pick up the old TT entries but one should most likely just leave them alone. Will update as we progress. Just remember to always back up a Restore Point, yes W10 does it usually, but do your own and also back up the Registry. UPDATE 3: Tried to uninstall the TT systems but it fails so we are stuck with them just sitting useless. Beware again of trying too much since I suspect you will mess up the Registry. TT has been a nightmare and hopefully the recent updates are not terminal as well. However on a separate stand alone system they function normally. UPDATE 4: I made the fatal mistake of updating to 21H2 and trying to remove the old TT. Surprise, another Registry shuffle and BOOM, lost MS Store and all related files even after a Restore Point. Solution, bought a new PC and must then scrub the old one, just 6 months old, back to a new OS load and restore all of it. This will take 20-24 hours at the very least.

Note that although this product is directly from Acronis, if you go to Acronis dot com you'll find they want you to \"upgrade\" to \"Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office\" - ATI-2021 isn't offered at all. I'm tempted to removed another star because the new product (not this one) is subscription only, and not a cheap one at that. But since I haven't actually installed this 2021 product yet, and will definitely *not* be \"upgrading\" to the subscription plan, will withhold judgement. I am a registered user of Acronis True Image 2020, 2017, OEM (2015), 2014, 2011 and 2009. This review will be updated if anything more significant is found. Update: No changes in stars and this will be my last Acronis product. Installed this 2021 version and ran without problems on a Dell 2-in1 Win10. I saw no discernible changes from my 2020 copy, hopefully it will work better as the 2020 copy was definitively flaky on some systems, I suspect because of the then new tibx backup format. Although they are pushing their cloud storage and anti-malware features, they are not required.

Available in two sizes, 68 x 48 and 68 x 44, this baseball return trainer can easily fit in a backyard, on a patio, or in any open space.\n\nImprove catching skills with a baseball throw net that allows for pitch-back practice. Don’t waste time with an inferior baseball training net that warps or tears.

I find it to be a fun and relaxing activity to throw a hard baseball at it and catch the returns. I'm 60-something, so i'm not throwing fastballs and it works fine for me. The grandkids (ages 5 & 9) get a kick out of throwing tennis balls at it and trying to catch the return. The net and frame seem durable enough for our usage and I'm confident it is going to last for many years and I will definitely store it inside during our midwest winters. ASSEMBLY: It's not easy to assemble, I didn't really have any big problems but i am fairly handy. The directions aren't great-- i went by the photo on the box for the placement of the net and bungee cords. Deciding where to place the bungee cords is kind of like a math puzzle of sorts. If you don't enjoy the fun and challenge of assembly you're likely going to find this difficult. ONE PROBLEM: the pins that come with this net are for adjusting the legs to the 5 different positions. They go in ok initially, but i have found that they fall out frequently and searching for them in the lawn is a pain. Soooooooo, I went to the hardware store and bought 1/4\" pins that are 2 inches long with a locking wire loop (see attached photo for the 2 that I purchased and one of the original ones that fall out). These replacement pins cost $3.00 each. This of course would be a nice improvement for the manufacturer to make.

This of course would be a nice improvement for the manufacturer to make.<br>Overall we really like it and I would recommend for folks with a similar scenario. </span> </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IUJD0S0FDKH5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD739T8","rating":4,"date":{"raw":"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","utc":"2020-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"profile":{"name":"john d","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF73HSVCJ5YEXQRE36DXMD3UGQFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","id":"AF73HSVCJ5YEXQRE36DXMD3UGQFQ"},"vine_program":false,"verified_purchase":false,"images":[{"link":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"}],"helpful_votes":9,"review_country":"us","is_global_review":false},{"id":"RYPX3FJX9X11V","title":"Seems to be pretty solid overall.","body":"I'm writing this after one use, so I have no idea how long it will last, but here are my initial impressions...
